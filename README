#IntroGeneticAlgorithm

This is an intro level Genetic Algorithm written for the purposes of learning.

This program generates a pool of Chromosomes each with a random strand of Genes.

Each gene represents either a number(0 to 9), a math operationg (+-*/) or a space (meaning nothing).  It then goes through an evolution process until one of the Chromosomes comes up with the target solution.

The solution it finds will not be the most efficient solution.
